Being a machine for so long has its consequences. As there’s a point where someone can create an actual machine that challenges the self-worth you were fighting for, alone. For so long. Not only did it challenge your technical depth, but your creative side. All trust was gone. 

But, you forgot one thing. All the important moments you missed during that war. The extra time you spent tackling vague questions around love, the extra time that you could have fought for someone in a human way rather than programmatic. You were suffocating within a false idea your surroundings had set. 

You simply wanted to *create*, but you needed free time too, and the only way to get free time was to succeed at an unprecedented scale. Maybe, there’s a healthier way. A better one for others, so they can do it with *grace* instead of *rage.*
