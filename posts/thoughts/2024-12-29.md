This whole year was a constant battle between every demon of the past, magnified by each weekly event. I am usually not known to be one of self-control, always been an “all or nothing” type of person. Which in some cases, is a strength that helps me win some things, but not all. This year something unique happened, one of those very demons could have been absolved if I were simply present. I really disliked the notion of meditation, because at some-point I got so lost in the process of thinking 5/10/15 years ahead. And with the surroundings, the competition, the merit-less leaders and the grind mind-set I stared into the abyss. And, it actually does stare back. It’s a nasty stare, in-fact.

But, if I was present during some key moments, I would have had that person. A team-mate, a *real* friend maybe. I think ego made me blind while not being intelligent enough to handle the noise. Not being confident enough in my own beliefs. I never knew, I could get a concrete example, in memory, of the notion of “Being Present”. An actual tangible example… 

There’s always a silver lining and I am very grateful for that at least.

Happy New Years.
