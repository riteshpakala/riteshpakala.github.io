Starting January 20, 2025. Will be logging trades in an active portfolio. Writing monthly stories around the variables that contributed towards positive gains. Focusing on objective analysis with some potential cultural impacts. Want to also identify black swan events and how to capture potential value in post (i.e. the CrowdStrike incident in 2024).

Currently, brainstorming how to view a site like BlueSky as a browser rather than a social network. ATProto being a window into mini apps that users can interact with while posting. We currently see some examples of this from the user [@dame](https://bsky.app/profile/dame.bsky.social).
